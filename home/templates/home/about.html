                Delivering Since 1827 
                The world famous Oldest Sweet Shop first opened its doors in 1827 and today is still selling and delivering quality traditional sweets and chocolates. 
                Nearly two centuries of expertise and knowledge have gained us an unrivalled expertise in confectionery. As such our expertise mean we are regularly approached and featured in the media, including high profile newspapers, magazines and TV programmes. 
                From traditional old fashioned sweets such as humbugs, aniseed balls, pear drops, jelly babies to more recent additions “retro sweets” including cola bottles, popping candy and kola cubes.

                Most of our sweets are still crafted in the original way in England.  The boiling’s being done in copper pans and using sweet moulds quite often over a century old! 
                We sell locally handmade fudge and our superb chocolate range is sourced from the finest chocolatiers in Belgium and Switzerland. 
                In our historic shop, which is housed in a building dating back to the early 1600’s, customers young and old recognise the uniqueness of the vast range and display of traditional sweets and the quality of the chocolates and the knowledgeable service they receive. We strongly believe our online sweet shop should not be any different. We provide every order as if it is an important gift. Our sweets or chocolates are packed with care into quality cellophane bags to prevent loss of texture and to stop them sticking as they would in paper bags!
